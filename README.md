# msr

This is a dataset consisting of the music stretching resistance of 894 songs of various genres.
Music stretching resistance (MSR) measures the human tolerant stretching range of music pieces along the time axis.
The MSR of a single song consists of two values: *the maximum elongating rate* and *the minimum compressing rate*, 
within which range this song can be *safely* stretched using methods like WSOLA (Waveform Similarity based Overlap-Add).
